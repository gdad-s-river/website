I woke up late today. Because we team of 6 have a daily quick ( really quick ) stand up meeting ( at our own desks ) at 12 noon, I had to rush. I reached office, opened my bag only to find that I had forgotten my laptop. It was weird because I never forget my laptop to work! I was perflexed, _how could this be?_.

When I had started for office, I had a intuition to check if I had it. But I got over it, thinking that I hadn't touched the bag since last evening â€” the laptop should obviously be there. I have forgotten things at weird places in the past, without having any memory of putting those things at those places. So I gave myself an error percentage plus o minus to being sure.

I came back home ( another half an hour bike ride in the gusty winds of dusty bangalore ), only to find that my laptop wasn't at home either!

I thought that because clothes, both washed and unwashed, were littered around the room, I was unable to search properly. Under this assumption, I cleaned my room a bit, but to no avail. I brought my flatmate to do a search for me, just in case I was out of my head, searching already searched places over and over again. He couldn't find it either!

I went back to my office, and checked the CCTV feeds. I saw myself picking up the laptop, my back visible while doing so. At first it was hard to decipher from the angle of the camera if it was the laptop that I was putting in my bag. But the flourish with which I slide the laptop in from my hands into the bag ended the conundrum. It was the laptop. So when I got out of the office, I had my laptop in my bag. Sorted so far.

I visited the three shops which I had visited the evening before. Nothing to be gained out of there as well.

Then I called Rama g to take help from her intuition kids ( kids with astounding intuition powers, to be able to pin point, for example, lost items, with a breaktaking track record, it's sounds miraculous ( if you do not understand what state of mind causes it, especially in children ). They told ( both of them independently ) that they could see the laptop in the 3rd white drawer of a table. Unfortunately I couldn't find that drawer or table.

Now I'm going to have to fill an FIR report for it, and wait for the new laptop to be assigned. And do the dev set up again. Arrrrggggghhh!
