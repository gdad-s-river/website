This sign is what I've been looking for? Hardly. That's the thing about the situations which you have to say no to. Those situations fly onto your face directly, without any warning. They spring forth like Monday, unwanted. They are like flies, mosquitoes. Sometimes they come undetected and bugger and sting.

And when you have to say no to that situation or ask, you had better have an embed in a part of your personality ‚Äî to say no. When that is not embedded, people might start taking you for granted, that you'd never say no ( and you wouldn't ). If I say that I was forced to participate in the fashion show that is happening in the office ( I don't even know what event it's a part of ), I could be burned by his words ( he loves using words, doesn't he? üòè ). But I really didn't want to participate ( I don't like fashion shows, I don't get them! )

I went upto the extent of not picking summoning calls for practice ( one of my close friends in office had started jocosely emotionally black mailing me with _this is not done_ messages). I had been hiding, when I was found by her ( a colleague, the person who loves words' fiance ), I had to submit. Because that's what I do üòû. I am unable to say no. Thing is, that I exude a polite nature to people ( which happens naturally ). Saying _no I won't do it at any cost_ makes me afraid, that I'd be kept a grudge against. I don't want that. I want everyone to talk nicely to me, always. This is a big problem. It pushes me down to the abyss of being tacit, gullible ‚Äî¬†to be able to have no opinions, and most importantly to not be able to emerge as a leader and take stands.

I just laughed it off, when I found on reaching the venue for practice, that she wasn't participating herself! I was mad for a second. But I can't stay mad for longer than that, it's a time waste. I'm being made a sheikh for a fashion show. The only reason I agreed to do it was because I might become a reason for people to laugh. That's a good reason.

Also I got to meet a stunning, enchanting, charming woman. She was kind and offered us maggi. Helped a colleague who was struggling with the ramp walk with a booster _if that doesn't happen, so what! we'll try something else then_. She was a Miss India contestant in some year. We couldn't take eyes off her ( I wasn't able to take eyes on her, I'm never able to even see a girl for a moment, in fear of being caught (for what?!) ).
